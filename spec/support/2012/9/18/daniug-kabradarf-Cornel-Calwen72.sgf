TomoyaKun [3d\]: l3
despot [2k\]: call it that if you want, sabaki involves playing light moves
]

despot [2k\]: ...
Intuit [15k\]: haha

domie [1k\]: why are you talking about sabaki here ?
Intuit [15k\]: so pseudo-sabaki then?
]
;B[il]BL[347.754]C[Intuit [15k\]: because I misunderstood the term
despot [2k\]: that's a good reason :)

domie [1k\]: indeed this position has nothing to do with sabaki

;W[li]WL[89.659]C[Intuit [15k\]: idk n4 does give resilient shape, which is one feature of sabaki
MOEN [4k\]: before
]
;B[lk]BL[309.376]C[wither [3k\]: hey thats something cornel can do. make moves that force calwen to respond
Intuit [15k\]: also it can be discarded, so is light, which is also a feaute of sabaki

despot [2k\]: l12?
Intuit [15k\]: j10 i think could work here
godango [4k\]: i don't think j10 works quite yet
polemus: it is hard to imagine the sequences that a 2dan/ 73dankyu will play
guest556: yes j10 is legal under japanese rules
godango [4k\]: why under japanese rule?
despot [2k\]: yeah j10 seems to work
yarik94 [4k\]: l12
guest556: godango click options->rules
]
;B[kh]BL[172.929]C[godango [4k\]: but it's "legal" under all rules...?

yarik94 [4k\]: after black j10
]
;B[ij]BL[155.95]C[godango [4k\]: yay

godango [4k\]: hmm which rules say that? first i've heard of it
LaaMaiLee [2d\]: I like the ones where you get new move if you make 5 in a row

godango [4k\]: lol right
guest556: i don't know check out senseis :)
polemus: j11 ??
